The file HWSD_gdb.zip contains the Harmonized World Soil Database (Version 1.21, udated 7 March, 2012) downloaded from IIASA (http://webarchive.iiasa.ac.at/Research/LUC/External-World-soil-database/HTML/). Three files were downloaded: (1) HWSD_RASTER.zip (containing three files: the bandinterleaved image (hwsd.bil, 1.7 Gb), a small file giving the extent and resolution [hwsd.blw], and the header [hwsd.hdr]), (2) HWSD.mdb,  and (3) HWSD_META.mdb. The two microsoft access database files were converted to ARCGIS geodatabase fiels (.gdb) for easier processing in R.
